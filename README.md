## Overview
- This app is made purely with the Django framework and a PostgresQL database.

## Included
- Full CRUD functionality
- A One-to-Many relationship model
- A Many-to-Many relationship model

## Stretch Goals
- AUTH (Django)

## Revisit
- The relationships in the models could be fine-tuned. Heroes and Villains should be One-to-Many but I couldn't get Villain to be defined above the Villain class where the Hero class would set Villain as One-to-Many.
